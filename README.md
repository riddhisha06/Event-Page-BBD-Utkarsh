# 🎉 Event Page for BBD Utkarsh

This project is a **basic front-end event website** developed for **Utkarsh**, the **annual cultural and technical fest** of **Babu Banarasi Das University (BBDU)**. The website is designed to act as an **informational and registration platform** for the fest, providing visitors with essential details about the event in a simple, structured, and visually clean manner.

The main aim of this project is to present fest-related information such as the **event overview, background, contact details, and participant registration** in an organized format using fundamental web technologies. It focuses on clarity, accessibility, and ease of navigation, making it suitable for both students and organizers.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **HTML and CSS** concepts, including page structuring, form design, styling, and multi-page navigation. It can be easily extended in the future by adding JavaScript functionality, backend integration, or dynamic features like event schedules, galleries, or live updates.

The website consists of multiple sections and pages:
- A **homepage** introducing the Utkarsh fest  
- An **About page** describing the fest and its purpose  
- A **Registration page** for participant data collection  
- A **Contact page** for communication and queries  

Overall, this project serves as a **foundational web development project** suitable for academic submission, fest promotion, or as a base template for future college event websites.
